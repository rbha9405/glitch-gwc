# Starter Code File Overview

Your full activity instructions are in HQ, but here's a little cheat-sheet of the files in this project:

## ← index.html

This is your homepage. It should be the first page that you work on.

## ← about.html

This will be your about page.

## ← take-action.html

This will hold your action item checklist and action description.

## ← script.js

Later this week, you'll edit this file to create your checklist.

## ← styles.css

ThIS file contains the CSS rule sets for index.html and any universal elements for all pages.
We've already included a lot of them for you, but you should customize it as you want.

## ← about.css

## ← take-action.css

This file contains the CSS rule set for take-action.html.
