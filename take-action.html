        <p id="script">
          Hello, my name is [insert name here] and I live in [district, county,
          or city]. I am calling to ask you to support basic self defense
          education in the physical education curriculum. We are submitting a
          petition for the same cause.
          <br />
          As a teenage student, I want to be able to tackle bullying and harrassment and being able to defend myself. Please consider supporting our cause.
